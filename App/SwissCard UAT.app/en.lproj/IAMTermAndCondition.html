                <strong>Terms of Use</strong>&rdquo;), as part of the contractual relationship between the Customer and the Issuer, regulate their relationship with regard to Swisscard Login. These Terms of Use are valid in addition to the other applicable provisions governing the contractual relationship between the Issuer and the Client, especially the &ldquo;Terms and Conditions for Charge Cards and Credit cards of Swisscard AECS GmbH&rdquo; (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;
                <strong>GTCs</strong>&rdquo;), the provisions governing the individual Offers, and the legal notices and the data protection statement, which can be found on the Swisscard Login web page. In the case of any contradictions, the present Terms of Use shall have priority.

            </p>
            <p>
            <span style="font-size:14px">2.1 Registration occurs when the Client provides information about him/herself and about his/her card account using the online form provided for this purpose. Completion of registration will subsequently be confirmed to the Client by the Issuer in a suitable manner. The Issuer can require additional steps to complete registration (e.g., sending a verification code). The Issuer is free to reject the Client&rsquo;s registration at any time and without stating reasons.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
            <span style="font-size:14px">2.2 Registration and use of Swisscard Login require that the Client have a valid e-mail address as well as a mobile telephone with a valid mobile telephone number. The Issuer can require additional or changed requirements such as installing a mobile application (&ldquo;App&rdquo;) for future use. The Issuer can additionally make the use of specific offers dependent upon additional authentication actions, for instance input of an activation code.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
            <span style="font-size:14px">2.3 During registration, the Client selects a user name that may not be misleading, illegal, or offensive, and a static password pursuant to Section 4.2. Registration for Swisscard Login takes place over an encrypted connection.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
            <span style="font-size:14px">2.4 In each case, registration applies to all cards in the Client&rsquo;s name. Separate registration is required for corporate cards.</span>

            <p>
            <span style="font-size:14px">2.5 The Client shall immediately inform the Issuer in case of any change in mobile device, mobile telephone number, or e-mail address.</span>

            </p>
            <p>
            <span style="font-size:14px">3.1 Swisscard Login authenticates the Client and provides the Client with technical access to specific offers from the Issuer. This access through Swisscard Login requires in each case that the Client has registered to use Access Manager and has provided authentication in the manner required by Swisscard Login.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
            <span style="font-size:14px">3.2 Access to the individual offers through Swisscard Login is granted by entering the user name and the password and, depending on the offer, with an additional factor provided by the Issuer, for instance by entering a code (mTAN) transmitted by SMS or push message to the Client&rsquo;s most recently registered mobile telephone number or through an app. The additional factor provided may be supplemented, changed, or replaced by the Issuer at any time. Further regulations for access to the Offers through Swisscard Login in the provisions governing the individual Offers are reserved.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
            <span style="font-size:14px">3.3 The range of Offers accessible via Swisscard Login can be expanded or restricted by the Issuer.
                <strong>Access to Offers can also be made dependent on use of Swisscard Login. </strong>
            </span>
            </p>
            <p>
            <span style="font-size:14px">3.4 The User acknowledges that login to Swisscard Login enables access to the Issuer&rsquo;s Offers and use of these Offers in the name of and for the account of the Client.
                <strong> Depending on the nature and scope of an Offer, login to Swisscard Login may therefore enable, e.g., access to the Client&rsquo;s current and historical transaction data and other data, change of client data, confirmation of transactions, performance of card transactions, processing of loyalty programs including redeeming points and other actions. </strong>Anyone who logs in to Swisscard Login shall be considered by the Issuer to be an authorized person for use of Swisscard Login and the related Offers, and all actions relating to an Offer undertaken after login to Swisscard Login shall be considered as approved by the Client.
                <strong>The Client shall thus comply in particular with the duties of care pursuant to Section</strong>4
                <strong>.</strong>
            </span>
            </p>
            <p>
            <span style="font-size:14px">3.5 The Client further acknowledges that the use of Swisscard Login from abroad may violate provisions of foreign law under certain circumstances. The Client is responsible for obtaining information in this regard. The Client further acknowledges that import and export restrictions may exist for the encryption algorithms, which he may violate under certain circumstances if he uses Swisscard Login outside of Switzerland. In case of doubt, the Client must refrain from using Swisscard Login from abroad. The Issuer declines any liability in this respect.</span>

                <strong>4.1 The Client acknowledges that unauthorized access to Swisscard Login also enables abuse of the related offers (Section 3.4). </strong>The Client shall therefore take all measures necessary to the extent possible to exclude the risk of unauthorized access to Swisscard Login or unauthorized use.

            <span style="font-size:14px">5.1 The Issuer assumes no responsibility for the availability of Swisscard Login at any time. Furthermore, the Issuer does not facilitate data access to Swisscard Login (Internet connection). This is the Client&rsquo;s sole responsibility. The Issuer therefore assumes no responsibility for network operators (e.g. Internet Service Providers). Furthermore, the Issuer assumes no responsibility for the accuracy, precision, reliability, completeness, confidentiality, and transfer time of all electronically transmitted data.</span>

            <span style="font-size:14px">6.1 Within the framework of the Client&rsquo;s registration for Swisscard Login and the use of Swisscard Login, the Issuer receives and processes personal data about the Client (and for companies, about the Client&rsquo;s company bodies and employees), e.g., e-mail addresses and mobile telephone numbers. The data protection notices in Section 11 GTCs apply to these data.</span>
            </p>

                <strong>6.2 The Client is obligated to notify the Issuer immediately of changes in the information provided when registering for Swisscard Login, such as changes in the e-mail address or mobile telephone number in particular. </strong>Until such a notice is received, the Issuer is authorized to consider the information most recently provided as valid information.

            <span style="font-size:14px">6.3 The Client expressly agrees that the Issuer may communicate using electronic means, including the Internet, e-mail, and SMS, within the context of use of Swisscard Login. He/she acknowledges that data transmitted over a public network such as the Internet or an e-mail service can in principle be viewed by anyone. The Issuer cannot guarantee the confidentiality of messages or documents transmitted through such open networks. Third parties may access this information, and may consequently collect and use the data without the Client&#39;s consent. Under certain conditions, third parties could use this information to make conclusions regarding existing or future card relationships or other business relationships (such as banking relationships). Even if the sender and recipient are located in the same country, data transmission within such networks frequently also occurs through third countries, i.e., including countries that do not offer the same level of data protection as does the Client&#39;s country of domicile. The Client&#39;s data could be lost during transmission or could be intercepted by unauthorized third parties.</span>

            <p>
