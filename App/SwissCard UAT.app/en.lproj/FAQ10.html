        <p>The expense tracker clearly shows you what you have used your card for in a specific period. Your purchases are shown according to your allocation based on the amount and as a percentage per defined category. The analysis is also presented clearly in a graph. You can define the corresponding categories yourself.</p>
        <p>Go to the &quot;Expense tracker&quot; menu in the app. Then select the &quot;not categorized&quot; category. To allocate transactions to a category, swipe the transaction left with your finger and then click &quot;Categorize&quot;. You are then shown the selection of the categories you have defined. If you haven&rsquo;t defined any categories yet, you can create different categories depending on your requirements. For this, simply click the plus icon on the top right, choose a name and color and you have created the category.</p>
