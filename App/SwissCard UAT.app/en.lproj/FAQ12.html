        <p>You can see all transactions in the app that have definitely been posted to your card account. It may sometimes take a few days for the actual purchase to be booked as a transaction with Swisscard. This depends on when the merchant electronically submits the transaction to Swisscard. As soon as this is the case, you can see the transaction in the app.</p>
